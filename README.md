# ZenCycleBlockchainScore

ZenCycleBlockchainScore is a decentralized trust scoring system built to evaluate the trustworthiness of wallet addresses based on various on-chain activities. The project's goal is to help users of the Circles network (https://docs.aboutcircles.com/) answer the question, "Why should I trust this user?" or "Should I trust this user?" by providing a trust score for wallet addresses.

By leveraging blockchain data, trust scores are generated based on several factors such as wallet age, transaction count, past smart contract interactions, suspicious activities, and whether the wallet has an ENS (Ethereum Name Service) domain. These parameters are initially predefined but will be further refined through a **DAO** (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), allowing users to vote and adjust the criteria for trust score calculation. This flexibility ensures that the system evolves with the community's needs, facilitating safer and more meaningful interactions within the Circles ecosystem.

## Project Overview

The ZenCycleBlockchainScore project enables the creation of a trust score for a given wallet address based on a range of on-chain data points. This system utilizes the power of Oasis' Rofl technology and the Circles network to help users build trust with one another and avoid potentially harmful interactions.

### Why it Matters

On decentralized networks, trust is often established through reputation, which is hard to quantify. By using on-chain data and smart contracts, we can calculate a "trust score" that reflects the reliability and trustworthiness of a wallet address. This score allows Circles network users to make more informed decisions when interacting with others.

## Key Features

- **Trust Score Calculation**: Evaluates wallet trustworthiness based on several factors (decided by the DAO of **ZenCycle**) such as:
  - Wallet age
  - Transaction count
  - Previous smart contract interactions
  - ENS ownership
  - Suspicious transactions
  - Transaction spam

  The trust score will be calculated using an AI system, which analyzes these parameters and assigns a score to each wallet address. This AI-driven approach ensures dynamic and efficient evaluation based on real-time blockchain data.

- **Rofl Technology**: Utilizes Oasis' Rofl technology to create a privacy-preserving and secure trust scoring mechanism.
- **Smart Contracts**: Trust scores are stored securely in smart contracts deployed on the Oasis Sapphire network.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrates with Circles' platform to help users assess each other's trust levels.

## Technologies Used

- **Oasis Sapphire**: The platform that hosts and stores trust score data.
- **Rofl**: A technology provided by Oasis to generate verifiable proofs that ensure privacy and security.
- **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts deployed to store and manage trust scores.
- **Circles**: A decentralized social platform that enables users to evaluate and trust each other based on blockchain data.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction**: A user connects their wallet address to the ZenCycle platform.
2. **Data Collection**: The system gathers various data points from the blockchain, such as transaction history, wallet age, and ENS ownership etc.
3. **Trust Score Calculation**: The collected data is used to calculate the user's trust score based on predefined parameters.
4. **Rofl Technology**: The trust score calculation is verified using Oasis' Rofl technology, ensuring privacy and security.
5. **Smart Contract Storage**: The trust score is then stored in an Ethereum-based smart contract deployed on the Oasis Sapphire network.
6. **Circles Integration**: The trust score can be used within the Circles network to help users make more informed decisions about who to trust.

## Trust Score Calculation

The trust score is determined by evaluating the following parameters:

- **Wallet Age**: Older wallets are typically seen as more trustworthy.
- **Transaction Count**: Wallets with a higher number of legitimate transactions are deemed more trustworthy.
- **Smart Contract Interactions**: Wallets that have interacted with trusted smart contracts are given higher scores.
- **Suspicious Transactions**: If a wallet is found to have a history of suspicious transactions, its score is lowered.
- **ENS Ownership**: Wallets that own an ENS domain can have a higher trust score, as it indicates more engagement with the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Oasis Rofl Technology

This project integrates Oasis' **Rofl** technology (https://docs.oasis.io/build/rofl/), which provides a privacy-preserving mechanism for generating and verifying trust scores. Rofl ensures that no sensitive wallet data is exposed, allowing users to prove the validity of their trust score without revealing their full transaction history.

## Smart Contracts

Trust scores are stored and managed in smart contracts deployed on the **Oasis Sapphire** network. You can access the smart contract repository at:
